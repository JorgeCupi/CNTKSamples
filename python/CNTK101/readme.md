# CNTK 101 #
In this this repo mini series we'll cover how to go from zero to semi hero in CNTK.
We'll learn how to read data, define a model, train the model and test it using simple examples and explaning some math and ML concepts.

The parts of the mini series are:
- [HelloCNTK](https://github.com/JorgeCupi/CNTKSamples/tree/master/python/CNTK101/01_HelloCNTK)
- [ComparingTensors](https://github.com/JorgeCupi/CNTKSamples/tree/master/python/CNTK101/02_ComparingTensors)
- [Variables](https://github.com/JorgeCupi/CNTKSamples/tree/master/python/CNTK101/03_Variables)
- [DataReaders](https://github.com/JorgeCupi/CNTKSamples/tree/master/python/CNTK101/04_DataReaders)
- [Layers](https://github.com/JorgeCupi/CNTKSamples/tree/master/python/CNTK101/05_Layers)
- [Loss and Error](https://github.com/JorgeCupi/CNTKSamples/tree/master/python/CNTK101/06_LossAndError)
- [Training](https://github.com/JorgeCupi/CNTKSamples/tree/master/python/CNTK101/07_Training)
